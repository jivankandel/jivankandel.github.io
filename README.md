## üìå Introduction

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Jeonbuk National University, specializing in AI-driven bioinformatics, with an expected graduation in August 2025. My research focuses on the application of artificial intelligence in drug discovery, particularly in 3D protein structure analysis, to enhance protein-ligand interaction prediction and facilitate computational drug design.

In addition to my academic research, I work as a Senior Computer Vision Developer at Cybord, applying deep learning and machine learning techniques to solve real-world challenges in industrial automation and defect detection. My multidisciplinary expertise spans computational biology, structural bioinformatics, and AI-driven molecular modeling, enabling the development of advanced predictive models for biomedical research.

I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science from Kathmandu University and a Master‚Äôs in Energy AI from Jeonbuk National University, providing me with a strong foundation in deep learning architectures, sequence modeling, and high-dimensional data analysis. My research has been featured in high-impact journals, including Nature Communications and Journal of Cheminformatics, contributing to advancements in biomolecular informatics, protein engineering, and AI-driven drug discovery.

My goal is to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and life sciences, driving innovation in computational drug discovery, genomics, and precision medicine by leveraging advanced machine learning models and molecular simulation techniques to accelerate therapeutic development.
